            This is a photo of my best friend, Olivia. It was taken by me during a photoshoot we did for fun during winter break. I chose this photo because it is my work and it is one of my favorites from the shoot. We are both very interested in fashion and I love doing photography as a hobby, so we decided to go out and shoot. Being home from college for winter break can become a bit monotonous, so I remember this being really fun to get out and be creative. These photos aren't really for anything specific; it will be fun to look back on them when we are much older.
